# Avara Variable

Avara Variable is a fork of [Velvetyne Type Foundry][vtf]â€™s curveless type family [Avara][avr], which has the unusual constraint of placing all points on a strict square grid, dividing the cap height into twenty increments.

Avara Variable adds a Thin (100) weight and makes outlines compatible across the weights to enable variable font interpolation. The original Bold and Black designs are treated as the 500 and 900 weights respectively. This fork also includes much wider language support than currently provided by Avara.
